# `rid`
Joke command for the Windows command line. Prints out sarcastic messages whenever you incorrectly type `dir`. Think of it as an homage to [`sl`](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) but for Windows.

It's done in .NET C#, but I might rewrite the program in C++. Probably not, though. (if I do I might make it multiplatform)
