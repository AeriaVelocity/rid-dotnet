# `rid`
Joke command for the Windows command line. Prints out sarcastic messages whenever you incorrectly type `dir`. Think of it as an homage to [`sl`](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) but for Windows.

It's done in .NET C#, but I might rewrite the program in C++. If I do it'll be in a separate repository, and it'll probably have a different name.

By the way, it's .NET Framework, not .NET Core, so it'll only compile on Windows, unless you took the existing code and retargeted it for .NET Core. (you may have to remove a few lines of code to get it to compile for macOS or Linux)
